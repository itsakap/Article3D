This project allows children to share with each other cool science articles.

In a (hopefully not dystopian) future where everyone has convenient access to 3D printers, a 3D-printed object(s) may accompany an article.  As a child, I would like to 3D-print these supplementary materials so that I may enhance my learning experience.
